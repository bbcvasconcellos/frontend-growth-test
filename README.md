## Bonus Points

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to get started and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

## Submission

Upon completing the test, publish your project to a URL (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) and send the compressed code to the informed email instead of submitting a pull-request.

Good luck! ðŸš€
