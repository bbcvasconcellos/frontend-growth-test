![Screen](./.github/screen.png)

## Requirements

- The project is bootstraped using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).
- Implement this design using React and Typescript.

## What we will evaluate

- Pixel perfect
- Code structure and reusablity
- Semantics

## Bonus Points

- The header and menu should be the same HTML for all breakpoints.
- Good accessibility.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to get started and run the API server and development server:

```bash
npm run server & npm run dev
```

**global**

Consume the `/global` route for generate common components of the layout: header, footer, and social links.

**pages**

Consume the `/pages` route for generating the page's sections.

## Submission

Upon completing the test, publish your project to a URL (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) and send the your repo link to the informed email instead of submitting a pull-request.

Good luck! ðŸš€
